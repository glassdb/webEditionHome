##New License Web Edition Terms for 3.2
With the release of [GemStone 3.2](gemstone3.2release.md), GemTalk Systems is announcing a 
[new pricing structure for the GemStone/S 64 Web Edition][1] ([FAQ][2]).

[In February, I sent mail to the GLASS community][3] where we announced our intention to 
change the license agreement:

> For the GemStone 3.2 release and beyond  we are considering tweaking the terms of the Free for Commercial Use license....
>
> No changes will be made to the current terms of 2.x, 3.0.x, or 3.1.x Free for Commercial Use licenses. I repeat, no changes to license terms for 3.1.x and earlier!
>
> Moving forward with 3.2 and beyond, we feel that the current license is too generous with respect to repository size and we also feel that the prices for upgrading the SPC size and/or purchasing technical support are too expensive. 
>
> With regards to technical support we will continue to provided free technical support via this mailing list, but as you may have noticed in recent years I have not always been quick to respond to issues and that is probably not acceptable if you are trying to run a business:)

In the mail message we solicited feedback from the community and received a fair number of responses that greatly influenced our final decisions.

In a nutshell the changes can be boiled down to four major areas:

1. A perpetual **Starter** license is shipped with the product. The license has notable restrictions,
   when compared to the *Free for Commercial Use* license provided with earlier versions of GemStone (3.1.x
   and earlier), 
   but those restrictions are in line with the free licenses offered by other data base
   vendors, while still allowing commercial use.
2. A subscription **Limited** license is avaialable via email. The license is still more restricted than 
   the earlier license, but the restrictions are pretty generous and in accord with our intentions for
   what we consider fair "Free for Commercial Use* terms.
3. A subscription **Full** license is available for purchase ($1500/yr). The **Full** license is
   equivalent to the older *Free for Commercial Use* license. The **Full** license also provides for 
   limited [technical support][4] (5 tickets).
4. Three additional subscription licenses are available: **Extended SPC**, **Extended CPU**, and 
   **Extended Full**. The new licenses provide options for increasing the size of the SPC to 4G and/or
   increasing the number of CPUS. Limited [technical support][4] is also provided.
