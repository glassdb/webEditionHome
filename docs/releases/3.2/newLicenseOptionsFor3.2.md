##New License iWeb Edition Terms for 3.2
With the release of [GemStone 3.2](gemstone3.2release.md), GemTalk Systems is announcing a 
[new pricing structure for the GemStone/S 64 Web Edition][1] ([FAQ][2]).

[In February, I sent mail to the GLASS community][3] where we announced our intention to 
change the license agreement:

> For the GemStone 3.2 release and beyond  we are considering tweaking the terms of the Free for Commercial Use license. For reference, the current terms are available here[1]. 
> 
> No changes will be made to the current terms of 2.x, 3.0.x, or 3.1.x Free for Commercial Use licenses. I repeat, no changes to license terms for 3.1.x and earlier!
>
> Moving forward with 3.2 and beyond, we feel that the current license is too generous with respect to repository size and we also feel that the prices for upgrading the SPC size and/or purchasing technical support are too expensive. 
>
> With regards to technical support we will continue to provided free technical support via this mailing list, but as you may have noticed in recent years I have not always been quick to respond to issues and that is probably not acceptable if you are trying to run a business:)
