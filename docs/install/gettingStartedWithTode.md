# Getting Started with TODE

tODE is known to work with GemStone/S 3.1.x and 3.2.x. tODE should work with
GemStone 3.0.x, but it has not been heavily tested. tODE can be used with 
GemStone 2.4.x, but there are some critical bugs that can cause the vm to 
crash, so only hard-core users should attempt to use tODE with GemStone 2.4.x.

1. [Install and Start GemStone](#install_and_start_gemstone]
