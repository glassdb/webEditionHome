#GLASS Home

[GLASS Home][4] is the new location for [GLASS][3] documentation and scripts. 

Over time documentation will be updated and 
consolidated into this location from the [Google glassdb project][1], the 
[(gem)Stone Soup blog][2], and other sources.

To use GLASS Home, [Fork][5] the GLASS Home project, so that you can keep up 
with the latest changes on the site and make your own contributions.

GLASS Home is not a replacement or substitute for standard [GemStone/S 64 
documentation][6]. GLASS Home provides supplemental material for using working
with the [GemStone Web Edition][7].
