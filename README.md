#Web Edition Home

[Web Edition Home][4] is the new location for [GemStone/S Web Edition][3]
(aka GLASS) documentation and scripts. 

Over time documentation will be updated and 
consolidated into this location from the [Google glassdb project][1], the 
[(gem)Stone Soup blog][2], [Programming Gems (on GemStone)][8], and other sources.

**Web Edition Home** is not a replacement or substitute for standard [GemStone/S 64 
documentation][6]. **Web Edition Home** provides supplemental material for working
with the [GemTalk's Web Edition for GemStone/S 64 Bit][7].
